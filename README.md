# CAP4630_HW5

The code in [this Python file](https://github.com/jwils133/CAP4630_HW5/blob/main/AI_HW_5_Question_7_Part_1.ipynb), shows the code we used to generate the visualizations of the decision trees. To run the code, you can open the Google Colab Notebook [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/138xTqKkmqiYsYDMmWb9o9jXsR3llb4BP?usp=sharing).

The visualization of the decision tree for the Iris dataset using the Gini coefficient as the criterion can be found [here](https://github.com/jwils133/CAP4630_HW5/blob/main/iris_gini.pdf). To view the decision tree for the Iris dataset using entropy as the criterion, view [this file](https://github.com/jwils133/CAP4630_HW5/blob/main/iris_entropy.pdf).

The visualization of the decision tree for the Breast Cancer dataset using the Gini coefficient as the criterion can be found [here](https://github.com/jwils133/CAP4630_HW5/blob/main/cancer_gini.pdf).
